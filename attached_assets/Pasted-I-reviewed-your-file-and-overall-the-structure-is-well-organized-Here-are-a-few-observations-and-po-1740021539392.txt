I reviewed your file and overall the structure is well‐organized. Here are a few observations and potential issues:

1. **Missing Imports:**  
   - In the `/rewards/balance` route you reference a table named `rewardsBalances` (used in the database query), but it isn’t imported from your schema. Make sure that it’s included in your imports from `"@db/schema"` or wherever it’s defined.  
   - Several Plaid ledger routes (e.g., `/plaid/ledger/start-sweeps`, `/plaid/ledger/stop-sweeps`, `/plaid/ledger/manual-sweep`) call methods on `ledgerManager`, yet there’s no import for `ledgerManager` at the top. Confirm that you’re importing or defining this variable correctly.

2. **Error Handling and Logging:**  
   - Your error handler and logging are robust, though you might consider adding more detailed error information (e.g., requestId) in the error responses when in development mode.

3. **Token Verification:**  
   - In your JWT verification middleware, you’re using a synchronous call to `authService.verifyJWT(token)`. If this method is asynchronous or might throw errors, consider wrapping it in a try/catch or using async/await.

4. **Type Safety:**  
   - You’ve enhanced type declarations (like `RequestWithUser`), which is great. Double-check that every dynamic type conversion (e.g., using `parseInt`) is validated—this will help avoid potential NaN issues.

5. **Modularity:**  
   - With a long routes file, you might consider splitting the routes into multiple files (for example, separate files for contracts, merchants, Plaid integrations, and rewards) for easier maintenance.

6. **Helper Functions Placeholders:**  
   - Functions like `generateVerificationToken`, `sendVerificationEmail`, etc., are marked as “not implemented.” Just ensure that these are implemented in production or appropriately handled if they’re only placeholders.

Overall, the code appears clean with proper middleware usage and error handling. Addressing the missing imports and confirming that all external services (like `ledgerManager`) are correctly imported should resolve any potential bugs. Let me know if you need further help with any specific issues!
