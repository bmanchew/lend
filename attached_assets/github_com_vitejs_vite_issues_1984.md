## Describe the bug

When I'm rendering a styled component, I get the following error:

"Uncaught Error: vite-plugin-react can't detect preamble. Something is wrong. See [vitejs/vite-plugin-react#11 (comment)](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/11#discussion_r430879201)"

## Reproduction

When creating a new project I don't run into this problem. However, I'm trying to integrate vite into my existing project. Everything seems to work fine, but when I render a styled-component it crashes.

## System Info

- `vite` version: "^2.0.0-beta.65"
- Operating System: macOS Big Sur
- Node version: v14.15.5
- Package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm) and version: npm 6.14.11

If a newly created project works as expected with `styled-components`, then you need to provide an actual reproduction.

I managed to reproduce my issue with a simple example. I pushed my code to the following repository:

[https://github.com/RichardWeug/vite-backend-integration-preamble-bug](https://github.com/RichardWeug/vite-backend-integration-preamble-bug)

I'm starting my webserver using PHP, using the following command:

**php -S localhost:8000**

I start vite using npx, using the following command:

**npx vite**

When you navigate to localhost:8000, it gives the error I described.

Ah, so you are serving the HTML over your PHP server. Unfortunately because of this, Vite plugins (in this case `@vitejs/plugin-react-refresh`) won't be able to inject its HTML modifications.

Since you are not using Node.js, you can't leverage Vite's programmatic API to inject those HTML modifications, so in this case you'll have to do it manually inject [this code](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-refresh/index.js#L24-L30) into your HTML:

```
<script type="module">
import RefreshRuntime from "/@react-refresh"
RefreshRuntime.injectIntoGlobalHook(window)
window.$RefreshReg$ = () => {}
window.$RefreshSig$ = () => (type) => type
window.__vite_plugin_react_preamble_installed__ = true
</script>
```

This isn't a bug per-se, but we probably want to consider how to improve that.

Thanks. I've added the code. However, this doesn't seem to fix the issue. I'm still getting the same error.

```
<script type="module">
    import RefreshRuntime from "/@react-refresh"
    RefreshRuntime.injectIntoGlobalHook(window)
    window.$RefreshReg$ = () => {}
    window.$RefreshSig$ = () => (type) => type
    window.__vite_plugin_react_preamble_installed__ = true
</script>
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/@vite/client"></script>
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:3000/assets/js/website.js"></script>
```

Hmm probably `import RefreshRuntime from "http://localhost:3000/@react-refresh"`

Thanks. That fixes it! However, I'm getting a different error now: "Uncaught ReferenceError: global is not defined". Is there some sort of setup I'm missing?

Declaring a `global` var before the scripts solved this for me.

```
<script>var global = window</script>
```

Just wanted to chime and add that this error could also happen when using certain micro-frontend frameworks.

Since each micro front-end can be its own ViteJS app (and server), the HTML that the user sees might not be handled or served by Vite at all.

Vite might only serve an entry point that can be mounted if the root application decides that it should.

One thing I was thinking, without full knowledge about what is possible, is that the [code mentionned above](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-refresh/index.js#L24-L30) perhaps could be programmatically injected by JavaScript instead of being appended in the Vite HTML entry point so that fast refresh works even when the app is mounted on a different server than the Vite server.

That way, perhaps it could be possible to make it so that multiple Vite micro front-end all have independent fast refresh.

This could also be a manual step since it's an edge case like `import 'vite/fast-refresh'` inside the micro front-end.

(mostly thinking out loud here)
