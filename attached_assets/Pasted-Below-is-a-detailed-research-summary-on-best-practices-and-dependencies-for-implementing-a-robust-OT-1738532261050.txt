Below is a detailed research summary on best practices and dependencies for implementing a robust OTP (one‑time password) system—particularly for a borrower flow—and guidance to resolve “invalid confirmation code” issues. This summary includes recommended libraries, architectural suggestions, and GitHub references that you can review to help ensure that your OTP structure is accurate and reliable.

## Key Best Practices for OTP Implementation

1. **Secure OTP Generation and Storage:**  
   - **Use a Cryptographically Secure RNG:** Ensure that OTPs are generated using secure random number generators (e.g., Node.js’s `crypto.randomInt()` or equivalent in your platform) so that they are unpredictable.  
   - **Short Lifespan and One-Time Use:** OTPs should have a short validity window (typically 5–10 minutes) and be invalidated immediately after use or on expiration.  
   - **Hashing and Salting:** Store OTPs in a hashed form rather than plain text if persistence is necessary, and compare using secure hash comparisons.

2. **Rate Limiting and Retry Policies:**  
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  
   - Use retry counters and lock-out mechanisms if multiple failed attempts occur.

3. **Consistency in Input Formatting:**  
   - Normalize user input (e.g., trimming whitespace) before comparing the entered OTP with the stored value.  
   - Ensure the OTP is always generated, stored, and verified in the same format (typically as a numeric string).

4. **Clear Error Messaging:**  
   - Provide users with clear messages (without exposing internal details) if the OTP is invalid, expired, or if too many attempts have been made.

5. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
   - Log OTP generation, validation attempts, and errors (without logging sensitive OTPs) to help diagnose issues in production.
   - Monitor usage patterns to quickly detect anomalies in the OTP flow.

## Recommended Dependencies and Libraries

### Node.js and JavaScript Environment

- **crypto (built-in):**  
  Use Node.js’s built-in `crypto` module for generating secure random numbers. For example, `crypto.randomInt(100000, 999999)` for a 6-digit OTP.

- **OTP Libraries:**  
  Although many systems build OTP generation from scratch, some libraries can simplify the process:
  - **`otplib`:** A popular library for generating and validating OTPs. It supports both TOTP (time-based) and HOTP (counter-based) OTP schemes.  
    *GitHub:* [otplib/otplib](https://github.com/yeojz/otplib)
  - **`speakeasy`:** Another library that provides time-based and counter-based OTP generation and verification.  
    *GitHub:* [speakeasyjs/speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy)

These libraries help abstract the OTP generation and validation process, ensuring you adhere to standards like RFC 6238 for TOTP.

### Database and Caching Dependencies

- **Redis:**  
  For high-performance OTP storage and expiration management, consider using Redis. It offers built-in support for expiring keys and can be very efficient under high load.
- **Prisma or Mongoose (if using Node.js):**  
  Use a robust ORM/ODM for structured storage of OTP sessions if you need to persist attempts in your relational or NoSQL database.

## Example GitHub Repositories and References

- **Best OTP Implementation Example (Node.js):**  
  - [otplib/otplib](https://github.com/yeojz/otplib) provides comprehensive examples and documentation on how to generate and verify OTPs.  
  - [speakeasyjs/speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy) is another widely used project with examples for OTP generation.

- **Borrower Flow Example:**  
  While there isn’t a universal “borrower flow” OTP GitHub repo, many financial and lending platforms have implemented similar flows. Reviewing open-source lending platforms or financial authentication systems on GitHub (e.g., projects that implement multi-factor authentication in fintech) can provide additional insights.

## Troubleshooting “Invalid Confirmation Code” Issues

If you’re experiencing an “invalid confirmation code” error, consider these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Consistency in Generation and Verification:**  
   - Ensure that the same method is used for generating the OTP and that the verification logic does not alter the format (e.g., leading zeros or whitespace issues).
  
2. **Verify OTP Expiration:**  
   - Confirm that the OTP is still valid (not expired) when the user submits it. Implement a timestamp check with a clear expiration period.
  
3. **Normalize Input:**  
   - Trim spaces and remove any non-numeric characters from the user input before comparing it with the stored OTP.
  
4. **Review Logging:**  
   - Enable detailed (but secure) logging around OTP generation and verification steps to pinpoint discrepancies.
  
5. **Test Edge Cases:**  
   - Unit test with various input formats and edge cases to ensure that the OTP generation and validation work under all circumstances.

## Sample Code Snippet Using otplib

Here’s a quick example using `otplib` in Node.js for generating and verifying a TOTP:

```javascript
const { totp } = require('otplib');

// Set OTP expiration period (e.g., 5 minutes)
const OTP_EXPIRATION = 300; // seconds

// Generate a secret for the user (store securely)
const secret = totp.generateSecret();

// Generate a TOTP code
const otp = totp.generate(secret);
console.log(`Generated OTP: ${otp}`);

// Verification (userInput is the code entered by the user)
function verifyOTP(userInput, secret) {
  // Optionally log the comparison (without logging the actual OTP in production)
  console.log(`Verifying OTP. User Input: ${userInput}`);
  return totp.check(userInput, secret);
}

// Example usage
const userInput = "123456"; // Replace with actual user input
if (verifyOTP(userInput, secret)) {
  console.log("OTP verified successfully.");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid confirmation code.");
}
```

This example uses time-based OTP (TOTP) with the default configuration from `otplib`. Adjust parameters (such as step and digits) if needed to match your requirements.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

- **Adopt a Well-Reviewed OTP Library:**  
  Use a library like `otplib` or `speakeasy` for generating and verifying OTPs to ensure reliability and adherence to industry standards.

- **Implement Consistent Formatting and Storage:**  
  Normalize user input and store OTPs with proper expiration (using Redis or database fields with TTL).

- **Thoroughly Test the Borrower Flow:**  
  Write unit and integration tests to simulate the entire flow (OTP generation, sending, user entry, and verification) and address any inconsistencies leading to “invalid confirmation code” errors.

- **Review GitHub Examples:**  
  Examine repositories such as [otplib/otplib](https://github.com/yeojz/otplib) and [speakeasyjs/speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy) for best practices and inspiration for your implementation.
