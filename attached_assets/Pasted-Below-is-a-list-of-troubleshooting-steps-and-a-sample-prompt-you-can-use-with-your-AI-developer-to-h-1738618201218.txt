## Troubleshooting Steps for "Upgrade Required" Error in Socket.IO

1. **Verify Protocol Consistency:**
   - **Client vs. Server:** Make sure both your Socket.IO client and server are using compatible versions and the same protocol (HTTP vs. HTTPS). For instance, if your client connects via HTTPS but the server only supports HTTP, the upgrade (to WebSocket) might be rejected.
   - **Example Check:**  
     ```js
     const socket = io('https://yourdomain.com');
     // Ensure the server is also listening on HTTPS.
     ```

2. **Check Socket.IO Version Compatibility:**
   - Mismatched versions between the client and server can cause upgrade issues. Confirm that both sides are using the same major version of Socket.IO.
   - **Tip:** Look at your `package.json` files and compare the versions of Socket.IO on both the client and server.

3. **Review Server Configuration:**
   - **HTTP Upgrade Headers:** Verify that your server’s HTTP response includes the proper `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers for WebSocket handshakes.
   - **CORS and Proxy Settings:** If you’re behind a reverse proxy or firewall, ensure it’s configured to support WebSocket upgrades.

4. **Network and Proxy Configuration:**
   - If your application is deployed behind a load balancer or proxy, confirm that it supports WebSocket connections. Some proxies may need specific configuration to allow upgrade requests.

5. **Enable Detailed Logging:**
   - Enable logging on your Socket.IO server to capture handshake details and errors. This can provide insights into why the upgrade request is being rejected.
   - **Example:**
     ```js
     const io = require('socket.io')(server, {
       transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
       pingInterval: 10000,
       pingTimeout: 5000,
       allowUpgrades: true,
       // Enable debug logs
       debug: true
     });
     ```
   - Check the server logs for any errors during the upgrade process.

6. **Test in a Local Environment:**
   - Replicate the issue locally to rule out any hosting or network issues. Use a simple local client and server to see if the problem persists.

## Sample Prompt for Your AI Developer

You can use the following prompt to instruct an AI developer (or an AI coding assistant) to help troubleshoot the "Upgrade Required" error:

> **Prompt:**  
> "We are encountering a Socket.IO 'Upgrade Required' error on our server when trying to establish WebSocket connections for real‑time updates. Please help troubleshoot this issue by verifying the following:
> 
> 1. Check that the Socket.IO client and server are using compatible versions and the same protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).
> 2. Ensure that the server is correctly handling WebSocket upgrade headers (`Upgrade` and `Connection` headers) in its responses.
> 3. Review any reverse proxy or load balancer configurations to confirm they support WebSocket upgrades.
> 4. Enable detailed logging on the server to capture handshake errors.
> 5. Provide sample code for a basic Socket.IO setup with enhanced logging and version checks.
> 
> The goal is to isolate whether the issue is with version mismatches, protocol inconsistencies, or network/proxy configuration. Please generate a diagnostic checklist along with any code snippets necessary to help troubleshoot and fix this issue."

## Additional Tips

- **Use Tools Like `curl` or Postman:**  
  You can manually simulate the HTTP upgrade request to verify that your server responds correctly.
- **Consult Documentation:**  
  Refer to the [Socket.IO troubleshooting guide](https://socket.io/docs/v4/troubleshooting/) for more insights.

Following these steps and using the sample prompt should help narrow down the cause of the "Upgrade Required" error and lead you toward a solution. If you have additional context or logs, including them in the prompt can further improve the diagnosis.
